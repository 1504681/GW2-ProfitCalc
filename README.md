# GW2-ProfitCalc
 Use Selenium to fill out gw2profit form, then scrape the results. Output the results in a daily to-do list.
 
 Scraping data from [GW2 Profits](http://www.gw2profits.com/), and in the future going to use [Guild Wars 2 API](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main) to allow you to parse in your gold/materials.
 
 Just a hobby-project to help my friends complete their daily [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/) tasks, and to get more experience with Python and Selenium.
